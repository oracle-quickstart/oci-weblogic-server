# Oracle WebLogic Server for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

[Oracle WebLogic Server for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure][wlsoci] allows you to quickly create your Java Enterprise Edition
(Java EE) application environment in [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)][oci], including an Oracle WebLogic Server domain,
in a fraction of the time it would normally take on-premises.

Oracle WebLogic Server for OCI is available as a set of applications in the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace][marketplace].
After launching one of these applications, you use a simple wizard interface to configure and provision your domains along
with any supporting cloud resources like compute instances, networks and load balancers.

This Quick Start is an alternative to deploy an Oracle WebLogic Server for OCI stack, that can be used to automate the creation
of WebLogic domains in OCI. You can use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [Resource Manager (ORM)][orm] or the Terraform
command-line interface (CLI).

For more details on deploying the Oracle WebLogic Server for OCI stack on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, visit the
"Using Oracle WebLogic Server for OCI" [guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/weblogic-cloud/user/index.html).

## Common Topologies

WebLogic for OCI offers many options to customize your stack, to create new resources or use existing resources, use features
like Oracle Identity and Cloud Service, etc. 

The [solutions](./solutions) directory contains examples of different topologies that can be created in WebLogic for OCI, with 
sample tfvars files, and instructions to create the stack.

The following topologies are included:

| Solution                     | Features                                                                                                                              |

## Before You Begin with Oracle WebLogic Server for OCI

Whether you use Terraform CLI, ORM or the Marketplace to create a stack, you need to perform some pre-requisites. Refer
to the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/weblogic-cloud/user/you-begin-oracle-weblogic-cloud.html) for
the pre-requisite steps to using Oracle WebLogic Server for OCI.

For pre-requisites specific to Terraform CLI and ORM, see their corresponding section.

## Create Stack Using the Marketplace

To create, manage and destroy a WebLogic for OCI stack using the Marketplace, follow the instructions in the
[documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/weblogic-cloud/user/create-stack1.html).

## Create Stack Using the Terraform CLI

You need to install the following software in your computer to create a stack using Terraform CLI:
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Install the latest version
 - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). The scripts in this Quick Start requires Terraform version >= 1.1.2, < 1.2.0

First, get a local copy of this repo. You can make that with the commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/weblogic-server-for-oci.git
cd weblogic-server-for-oci/terraform
ls
```
Example output:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/weblogic-server-for-oci.git

$
```

*NOTE*: All the `terraform` commands must be run from the `terraform` directory.

Next, initialize the directory with the module in it. This makes the module aware of the OCI provider. You can do this by
running:

```bash
terraform init
```

Example output:

```bash
$ terraform init

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

```

### Configure variables for the stack

First, you need to set the image variables, depending on which WebLogic edition and type of license you want to use,
BYOL license or UCM license, when creating the stack.

The following files contain the values for those variables:
- [mp_image_se_byol.tfvars](./terraform/images/mp_image_se_byol.tfvars): WebLogic Standard Edition - BYOL
- [mp_image_ee_byol.tfvars](./terraform/images/mp_image_ee_byol.tfvars): WebLogic Enterprise Edition - BYOL
- [mp_image_ee_ucm.tfvars](./terraform/images/mp_image_ee_ucm.tfvars): WebLogic Enterprise Edition - UCM
- [mp_image_suite_byol.tfvars](./terraform/images/mp_image_suite_byol.tfvars): WebLogic Suite - BYOL
- [mp_image_suite_ucm.tfvars](./terraform/images/mp_image_suite_ucm.tfvars): WebLogic Suite - UCM

To use one of the files above:
- Copy the file from the `terraform/images` directory, to the `terraform` directory
- Rename the file from `terraform/mp_image_<edition>_<license>.tfvars` to `terraform/mp_image_<edition>_<license>.auto.tfvars`

For example, if you want to create a WebLogic Enterprise Edition UCM stack, copy the file `terraform/images/mp_image_ee_ucm.tfvars`
to `terraform/mp_image_ee_ucm.auto.tfvars`

Next, you need to configure [variables](./VARIABLES.md) to drive the stack creation. This can be done by creating a
`terraform.tfvars` file in the `terraform` directory, using as a base the tfvars files from one of the [solutions](./solutions).

Make sure the plan looks good. Once you created `terraform.tfvars` in the `terraform` directory, just run:

```bash
terraform plan
```

### Deploy

If that's good, you can go ahead and apply to deploy the stack:

```bash
terraform apply
```

You'll need to enter yes when prompted.

After the stack creation is complete, if you need to make changes to your stack (adding a new VM for example), you can edit
the variables in your `terraform.tfvars` file, and run the following commands:

```bash
terraform plan
# If the plan looks OK, run apply.
terraform apply
```
*NOTE*: Not all variables can be changed after a stack is deployed.

### Destroy the Deployment

**Important:** Refer to [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/weblogic-cloud/user/delete-domain.html)
for steps to perform before running *terraform destroy*.

When you no longer need the deployment, you can run this command to destroy it:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

You'll need to enter yes when prompted.

## Create Stack Using OCI Resource Manager

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [Resource Manager (ORM)][orm] allows you to manage your Terraform configurations and state.
To simplify getting started, the Terraform zip files for use with ORM are created as part of each [release](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/weblogic-server-for-oci/releases).

If you want to build the zip file to create an ORM stack, you need the following software:

*Linux*

- No additional software is required

*Mac OS*

- GNU sed

*Windows*

- Git bash (included in [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)) or any other software that allows you to run bash
  scripts in Windows
- The build scripts use the `zip` command. This is an example of how you can use a program like [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
  with the build scripts
1. Install 7-zip
2. Locate the file 7z.exe. Copy it to a directory that can be added to your path (e.g. ~/bin)
3. Create a script called `zip` in the same directory (e.g. ~/bin) with the following content:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
7z.exe a $@
```
4. Add the directory where you put the files (e.g. ~/bin) in your PATH
5. Verify zip command is recognized:
```bash
$ zip
 
7-Zip 22.01 (x64) : Copyright (c) 1999-2022 Igor Pavlov : 2022-07-15
 
 
 
Command Line Error:
Cannot find archive name
```

### Create the stack

To build the zip file to create an ORM stack, run the `builds/build_mp_bundles.sh` script.
```bash
$ cd builds/
$ ./build_mp_bundles.sh
Build the Oracle Resource Manager (ORM) bundles to deploy in Marketplace

Arguments: build_mp_bundles.sh -e|--edition <EE|SUITE|SE> -v|--version <12.2.1.4|14.1.1.0> -t|--type <UCM|BYOL> --all
options:
-e, --edition     WebLogic edition. Supported values are EE, SUITE, or SE. Optional when --all option is provided
-v, --version     WebLogic version. Supported values are 12.2.1.4 or 14.1.1.0. Optional when --all option is provided
-t, --type        Type of bundle. Supported values are UCM or BYOL. Optional when --all option is provided
--all             All bundles
```

For example, to create the zip file for a WebLogic 12.2.1.4 Enterprise Edition stack with BYOL license, run the following
command:

```bash
cd builds
./build_mp_bundles.sh --edition EE --version 12.2.1.4 --type BYOL
```

The zip files are generated in the `builds/binaries` directory.

Follow [these steps](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-stack-local.htm) to create
a ORM stack, using either a zip file from one of the [releases](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/weblogic-server-for-oci/releases),
or a zip file generated manually with the `build_mp_bundles.sh` script.

### Deploy the stack

After you create the stack, you can run a `plan` [job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-plan.htm)
to validate the resources that will be created.

If the plan looks good, you can run an `apply` [job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-apply.htm)
to deploy the stack.

After the stack creation is complete, you can
[manage the domain](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/weblogic-cloud/user/manage-domain-oracle-weblogic-cloud.html).

### Destroy the stack

**Important:** Refer to [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/weblogic-cloud/user/delete-domain.html) for
steps to perform before running a `destroy` job.

When you no longer need the deployment, you can run a
`destroy` [job](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/create-job-destroy.htm) to destroy the stack.
